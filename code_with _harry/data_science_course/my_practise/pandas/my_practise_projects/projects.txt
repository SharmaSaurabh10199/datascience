✅ Calculate monthly averages of temperature and humidity.
✅ Find the day with maximum rainfall.
✅ Plot temperature trends using matplotlib.
✅ Handle missing data if present.

🚀 Mini Project 2: Movie Ratings Analysis
Goal: Analyze a dataset of movies and their ratings.

Tasks:
✅ Load a dataset (title, genre, rating, year).
✅ Find the top 10 highest-rated movies.
✅ Find average ratings by genre.
✅ Filter movies released after 2015 with ratings above 8.0.
✅ Plot ratings distribution.

🚀 Mini Project 3: NumPy Matrix Operations
Goal: Practice numerical computation using NumPy.

Tasks:
✅ Generate two random matrices of size 3x3 and compute their:

Element-wise addition

Element-wise multiplication

Dot product

✅ Compute the eigenvalues and eigenvectors.
✅ Create a function to normalize the matrix rows.

🚀 Mini Project 4: Sales Data Dashboard
Goal: Build a lightweight dashboard in Jupyter using Pandas + Matplotlib.

Tasks:
✅ Load a CSV of sales data (Date, Product, Price, Quantity).
✅ Calculate total revenue by product.
✅ Find which product sold the most in quantity and revenue.
✅ Plot daily sales trends.
✅ Identify days with zero sales.

🚀 Mini Project 5: Personal Expense Tracker
Goal: Use Pandas to analyze your own expenses.

Tasks:
✅ Record your expenses in a CSV (Date, Category, Amount).
✅ Calculate monthly and category-wise totals.
✅ Identify top 3 categories where you spend the most.
✅ Plot a pie chart of your spending by category.
✅ Check for any duplicate entries and remove them.

🚀 Mini Project 6: Implement Linear Regression with NumPy
Goal: Understand how machine learning models use NumPy under the hood.

Tasks:
✅ Generate synthetic data using np.random (X: independent variable, y: dependent variable with noise).
✅ Implement linear regression using the formula:

𝜃
=
(
𝑋
𝑇
𝑋
)
−
1
𝑋
𝑇
𝑦
θ=(X 
T
 X) 
−1
 X 
T
 y
✅ Predict on new X values.
✅ Plot the regression line along with your data points using matplotlib.

🚀 Mini Project 7: Titanic Data Survival Analysis
Goal: Practice data cleaning, filtering, and groupby with a real dataset.

Tasks:
✅ Load Titanic dataset (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/datasciencedojo/datasets/master/titanic.csv).
✅ Clean missing values in Age, Cabin, and Embarked.
✅ Calculate survival rates overall and by:

Gender

Passenger Class

✅ Plot survival rates by gender using a bar plot.
✅ Create a new column "FamilySize" = SibSp + Parch + 1.

🚀 Mini Project 8: Student Marks Analysis
Goal: Learn data manipulation with Pandas and NumPy.

Tasks:
✅ Create a DataFrame with random marks of 50 students across 5 subjects.
✅ Calculate:

Each student’s total and average marks

Subject-wise average marks

Top 5 performers

✅ Plot a histogram of average marks.
✅ Identify students scoring below 40 in any subject.

How to execute:
✅ Pick one project at a time (1–2 days each).
✅ Document your findings in a Jupyter Notebook with markdown explanations.
✅ Use matplotlib or seaborn for at least one visualization per project.
✅ Share the notebook with me if you want feedback.
